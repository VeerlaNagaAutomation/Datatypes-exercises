try:
    print(x)
except:
    print("something went wrong")
    
finally:
    print("x is not defined")
    
    
#The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.

#The except block lets you handle the error.

#The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.

#The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

🔹 What is Multithreading? (Simple Concept)

Multithreading means:

Running multiple threads (lightweight tasks) within the same program at the same time.

Why use it?

Better CPU utilization

Faster execution

Perform multiple tasks concurrently

Real-life example:

One person talking while walking

One thread prints odd numbers

Another thread prints even numbers

🔹 Easy Multithreading Example (Python)
Requirement:

Thread-1 → prints odd numbers

Thread-2 → prints even numbers

Output → 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

✅ Simple & Interview-Friendly Code
import threading
import time

def print_odd():
    for i in range(1, 11, 2):
        print(i, end=" ")
        time.sleep(0.1)

def print_even():
    for i in range(2, 11, 2):
        print(i, end=" ")
        time.sleep(0.1)

t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_odd)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_even)

t1.start()
t2.start()

t1.join()
t2.join()

🔹 Output (Order may vary slightly due to scheduling)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

🔹 Key Points to Explain in Interview

✔ threading.Thread() → creates a new thread
✔ start() → starts thread execution
✔ join() → waits for thread to finish
✔ Threads share same memory
✔ Used for parallel tasks (I/O, automation, testing)

🔹 One-Line Interview Definition

Multithreading allows a program to execute multiple threads concurrently to improve performance and responsiveness.
