Below is a curated list of the MOST-ASKED Python DSA interview questions, based on real interviews (Intel / Qualcomm / AMD / NVIDIA / product companies).
I’ve grouped them by topic + priority, so you know what to prepare first.

🔴 MUST-KNOW (Asked in almost every interview)
1️⃣ Arrays / Lists

Reverse an array in-place

Find largest / smallest / second largest element

Move all zeros to end (in-place)

Rotate array by k steps

Find missing number in 1…N

Check if array is sorted

Remove duplicates from sorted array

Maximum sum subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm)

Find pair with given sum

Find duplicates in an array

2️⃣ Strings

Reverse a string (with & without built-in)

Check palindrome

Check anagram

Count character frequency

First non-repeating character

Longest substring without repeating characters

Reverse words in a sentence

Check if one string is rotation of another

Remove duplicates from string

Longest common prefix

3️⃣ Searching & Sorting

Binary search (iterative + recursive)

Find first & last occurrence of element

Search in rotated sorted array

Bubble / Selection / Insertion sort

Merge sort (concept + code)

Quick sort (partition logic)

Find kth largest/smallest element

Count occurrences using binary search

🟠 VERY FREQUENT (Strong signal questions)
4️⃣ Hashing (Dict / Set)

Two Sum problem

Count frequency of elements

Find duplicates using set

Longest consecutive sequence

Check if two arrays are equal

Subarray with zero sum

Majority element (Boyer–Moore)

5️⃣ Sliding Window / Two Pointers 🔥

Largest sum subarray of size K

Smallest subarray with sum ≥ target

Longest substring with K distinct characters

Move zeros / segregate even-odd

Container with most water

Trapping rain water

Pair with target sum (sorted array)

👉 Interview favorite topic

🟡 LINKED LIST (Common for 4–6 yrs)

Reverse a linked list

Detect loop (Floyd’s cycle)

Find middle of linked list

Merge two sorted linked lists

Remove nth node from end

Check palindrome linked list

Intersection point of two lists

🟢 STACK & QUEUE
Stack

Valid parentheses

Reverse string using stack

Next greater element

Min stack design

Evaluate postfix expression

Queue

Implement queue using stack

Circular queue

Sliding window maximum

First non-repeating character in stream

🔵 RECURSION (Interview clarity test)

Factorial

Fibonacci

Reverse string using recursion

Generate all subsets

Generate permutations

Tower of Hanoi

Check palindrome recursively

🟣 TREE & BST (Asked in Product Companies)

Tree traversals (In / Pre / Post)

Height of binary tree

Check balanced binary tree

Diameter of binary tree

Lowest Common Ancestor

Level order traversal

Validate BST

Invert binary tree

🔶 DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING (Tough but High Value)

Fibonacci using DP

Climbing stairs

Coin change

Longest common subsequence

Longest increasing subsequence

Knapsack (0/1)

Subset sum

Edit distance

⚫ Python-Specific DSA Questions (Very Important)

Time & space complexity of list, dict, set

list vs tuple

deepcopy vs shallow copy

== vs is

Mutable vs immutable

Why dict lookup is O(1)

How hashing works internally

Python recursion limit

collections.Counter use cases

Sorting using custom key
